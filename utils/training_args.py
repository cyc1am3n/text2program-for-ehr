class TrainingArguments:
    """
    TrainingArguments is the subset of the arguments we use in our example scripts **which relate to the training loop
    itself**.
    Using :class:`~transformers.HfArgumentParser` we can turn this class into `argparse
    <https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparse>`__ arguments that can be specified on the command
    line.
    Parameters:
        output_dir (:obj:`str`):
            The output directory where the model predictions and checkpoints will be written.
        overwrite_output_dir (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            If :obj:`True`, overwrite the content of the output directory. Use this to continue training if
            :obj:`output_dir` points to a checkpoint directory.
        do_train (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether to run training or not. This argument is not directly used by :class:`~transformers.Trainer`, it's
            intended to be used by your training/evaluation scripts instead. See the `example scripts
            <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples>`__ for more details.
        do_eval (:obj:`bool`, `optional`):
            Whether to run evaluation on the validation set or not. Will be set to :obj:`True` if
            :obj:`evaluation_strategy` is different from :obj:`"no"`. This argument is not directly used by
            :class:`~transformers.Trainer`, it's intended to be used by your training/evaluation scripts instead. See
            the `example scripts <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples>`__ for more
            details.
        do_predict (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether to run predictions on the test set or not. This argument is not directly used by
            :class:`~transformers.Trainer`, it's intended to be used by your training/evaluation scripts instead. See
            the `example scripts <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples>`__ for more
            details.

            The evaluation strategy to adopt during training. Possible values are:
                * :obj:`"no"`: No evaluation is done during training.
                * :obj:`"steps"`: Evaluation is done (and logged) every :obj:`eval_steps`.
                * :obj:`"epoch"`: Evaluation is done at the end of each epoch.
        prediction_loss_only (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to `False`):

                logging, evaluation, save will be conducted every ``gradient_accumulation_steps * xxx_step`` training
                examples.
        eval_accumulation_steps (:obj:`int`, `optional`):

            initialized parameters.
        fp16 (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether to use 16-bit (mixed) precision training instead of 32-bit training.
        fp16_opt_level (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to 'O1'):
            For :obj:`fp16` training, Apex AMP optimization level selected in ['O0', 'O1', 'O2', and 'O3']. See details

            The backend to use for mixed precision training. Must be one of :obj:`"auto"`, :obj:`"amp"` or
            :obj:`"apex"`. :obj:`"auto"` will use AMP or APEX depending on the PyTorch version detected, while the
            other choices will force the requested backend.
        fp16_full_eval (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether to use full 16-bit precision evaluation instead of 32-bit. This will be faster and save memory but

        dataloader_num_workers (:obj:`int`, `optional`, defaults to 0):
            Number of subprocesses to use for data loading (PyTorch only). 0 means that the data will be loaded in the
            main process.
        past_index (:obj:`int`, `optional`, defaults to -1):
            Some models like :doc:`TransformerXL <../model_doc/transformerxl>` or :doc`XLNet <../model_doc/xlnet>` can
            make use of the past hidden states for their predictions. If this argument is set to a positive int, the
            ``Trainer`` will use the corresponding output (usually index 2) as the past state and feed it to the model
            at the next training step under the keyword argument ``mems``.

            :class:`~transformers.notebook.NotebookTrainingTracker` in Jupyter Notebooks. Will default to :obj:`True`
            if the logging level is set to warn or lower (default), :obj:`False` otherwise.
        remove_unused_columns (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`True`):
            If using :obj:`datasets.Dataset` datasets, whether or not to automatically remove the columns unused by the
            model forward method.
            (Note that this behavior is not implemented for :class:`~transformers.TFTrainer` yet.)
        label_names (:obj:`List[str]`, `optional`):
            The list of keys in your dictionary of inputs that correspond to the labels.
            Will eventually default to :obj:`["labels"]` except if the model used is one of the
            :obj:`XxxForQuestionAnswering` in which case it will default to :obj:`["start_positions",
            "end_positions"]`.
        load_best_model_at_end (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether or not to load the best model found during training at the end of training.
            .. note::
                When set to :obj:`True`, the parameters :obj:`save_strategy` and :obj:`save_steps` will be ignored and
                the model will be saved after each evaluation.
        metric_for_best_model (:obj:`str`, `optional`):
            Use in conjunction with :obj:`load_best_model_at_end` to specify the metric to use to compare two different
            models. Must be the name of a metric returned by the evaluation with or without the prefix :obj:`"eval_"`.
            Will default to :obj:`"loss"` if unspecified and :obj:`load_best_model_at_end=True` (to use the evaluation
            loss).
            If you set this value, :obj:`greater_is_better` will default to :obj:`True`. Don't forget to set it to
            :obj:`False` if your metric is better when lower.
        greater_is_better (:obj:`bool`, `optional`):
            Use in conjunction with :obj:`load_best_model_at_end` and :obj:`metric_for_best_model` to specify if better
            models should have a greater metric or not. Will default to:
            - :obj:`True` if :obj:`metric_for_best_model` is set to a value that isn't :obj:`"loss"` or
              :obj:`"eval_loss"`.

            When resuming training, whether or not to skip the epochs and batches to get the data loading at the same
            stage as in the previous training. If set to :obj:`True`, the training will begin faster (as that skipping
            step can take a long time) but will not yield the same results as the interrupted training would have.
        sharded_ddp (:obj:`bool`, :obj:`str` or list of :class:`~transformers.trainer_utils.ShardedDDPOption`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Use Sharded DDP training from `FairScale <https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairscale>`__ (in distributed
            training only). This is an experimental feature.
            A list of options along the following:
            - :obj:`"simple"`: to use first instance of sharded DDP released by fairscale (:obj:`ShardedDDP`) similar
              to ZeRO-2.
            - :obj:`"zero_dp_2"`: to use the second instance of sharded DPP released by fairscale
              (:obj:`FullyShardedDDP`) in Zero-2 mode (with :obj:`reshard_after_forward=False`).
            - :obj:`"zero_dp_3"`: to use the second instance of sharded DPP released by fairscale
              (:obj:`FullyShardedDDP`) in Zero-3 mode (with :obj:`reshard_after_forward=True`).
            - :obj:`"offload"`: to add ZeRO-offload (only compatible with :obj:`"zero_dp_2"` and :obj:`"zero_dp_3"`).
            If a string is passed, it will be split on space. If a bool is passed, it will be converted to an empty
            list for :obj:`False` and :obj:`["simple"]` for :obj:`True`.
        deepspeed (:obj:`str` or :obj:`dict`, `optional`):
            Use `Deepspeed <https://github.com/microsoft/deepspeed>`__. This is an experimental feature and its API may
            evolve in the future. The value is either the location of DeepSpeed json config file (e.g.,
            ``ds_config.json``) or an already loaded json file as a :obj:`dict`"
        label_smoothing_factor (:obj:`float`, `optional`, defaults to 0.0):
            The label smoothing factor to use. Zero means no label smoothing, otherwise the underlying onehot-encoded
            labels are changed from 0s and 1s to :obj:`label_smoothing_factor/num_labels` and :obj:`1 -
            label_smoothing_factor + label_smoothing_factor/num_labels` respectively.
        adafactor (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether or not to use the :class:`~transformers.Adafactor` optimizer instead of
            :class:`~transformers.AdamW`.
        group_by_length (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether or not to group together samples of roughly the same length in the training dataset (to minimize
            padding applied and be more efficient). Only useful if applying dynamic padding.
        length_column_name (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"length"`):
            Column name for precomputed lengths. If the column exists, grouping by length will use these values rather
            than computing them on train startup. Ignored unless :obj:`group_by_length` is :obj:`True` and the dataset
            is an instance of :obj:`Dataset`.
        report_to (:obj:`str` or :obj:`List[str]`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"all"`):
            The list of integrations to report the results and logs to. Supported platforms are :obj:`"azure_ml"`,

            all integrations installed, :obj:`"none"` for no integrations.
        ddp_find_unused_parameters (:obj:`bool`, `optional`):
            When using distributed training, the value of the flag :obj:`find_unused_parameters` passed to
            :obj:`DistributedDataParallel`. Will default to :obj:`False` if gradient checkpointing is used, :obj:`True`
            otherwise.
        dataloader_pin_memory (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`True`)):
            Whether you want to pin memory in data loaders or not. Will default to :obj:`True`.
        skip_memory_metrics (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`)):
            Whether to skip adding of memory profiler reports to metrics. Defaults to :obj:`False`.
